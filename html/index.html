  <h1>RDFa Visualizer</h1>

  <h2>
    Start with HyperText.
  </h2>

  <p>Here is a pile of HTML files, all in a list. They link to each other and it's pretty cool. Each link has a <code>rel</code> or <code>property</code> attribute that defines the nature of the link â€“ that is, what kind of relationship it is.</p>

  <rdfa-toc></rdfa-toc>

  <h2>
    Convert hyper-text to JSON-LD via RDFa.
  </h2>

  <p>
    That <code>rel</code> or <code>property</code> attribute is RDFa microdata. This can be scraped out of the HTML and turned into a JSON-LD object:

  <h2>
    Use JSON-LD for good.
  </h2>

  <p>Using the very helpful <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld.js">jsonld.js</a> package, we can transform that JSON-LD object into all sorts of useful things.</p>

  <h3>
    Cast to a Tree
  </h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-framing/">JSON-LD framing</a> is a method o defining a shape you want on your array of nodes. For instance, we could be interested in the Human and their Friends, and want a tree of those friendly relationships. Frames are a way to <a href="https://json-ld.org/playground/#startTab=tab-framed&json-ld=%7B%22%40context%22%3A%7B%22%40vocab%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2F%22%2C%22contains%22%3A%7B%22%40type%22%3A%22%40id%22%7D%7D%2C%22%40graph%22%3A%5B%7B%22%40id%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Flibrary%22%2C%22%40type%22%3A%22Library%22%2C%22location%22%3A%22Athens%22%2C%22contains%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Flibrary%2Fthe-republic%22%7D%2C%7B%22%40id%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Flibrary%2Fthe-republic%22%2C%22%40type%22%3A%22Book%22%2C%22creator%22%3A%22Plato%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22The%20Republic%22%2C%22contains%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Flibrary%2Fthe-republic%23introduction%22%7D%2C%7B%22%40id%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Flibrary%2Fthe-republic%23introduction%22%2C%22%40type%22%3A%22Chapter%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22An%20introductory%20chapter%20on%20The%20Republic.%22%2C%22title%22%3A%22The%20Introduction%22%7D%5D%7D&frame=%7B%22%40context%22%3A%7B%22%40vocab%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2F%22%7D%2C%22%40type%22%3A%22Library%22%2C%22contains%22%3A%7B%22%40type%22%3A%22Book%22%2C%22contains%22%3A%7B%22%40type%22%3A%22Chapter%22%7D%7D%7D">get those structures.</a>

  <h3>
    Convert to Triples

  <p>
    Lastly, JSON-LD is just a serialization of your classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_triple">semantic triple</a> statement that goes "subject predicate object." You can then stick these into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore">triplestore</a> and run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">complex graph queries</a> on em. I like <a href="https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph">Oxigraph.</a>

    Now we can plug this in to a regular Observable or D3 network graph.
